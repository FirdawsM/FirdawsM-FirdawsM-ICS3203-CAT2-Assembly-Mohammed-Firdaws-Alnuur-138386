# FirdawsM-FirdawsM-ICS3203-CAT2-Assembly-Mohammed-Firdaws-Alnuur-138386
This repository contains four practical assembly programming tasks for the ICS3203 CAT 2 assignment. Each program demonstrates specific skills in assembly language, including control flow, array manipulation, modular programming, and hardware simulation.

## Task 1: Control Flow and Conditional Logic
Classifies a number as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or ZERO using conditional and unconditional jumps.

## Task 2: Array Manipulation with Looping and Reversal
Reverses an array of integers in place without using extra memory.

## Task 3: Modular Program with Subroutines for Factorial Calculation
Computes the factorial of a given number using a subroutine and stack-based register management.

## Task 4: Data Monitoring and Control Using Port-Based Simulation
Simulates a control program to respond to sensor values with appropriate actions.

## Compilation and Execution
- **Prerequisites**: Install [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) or another assembler.
- **To Compile**:

- **To Link and Execute** (using GCC as an example):

## Insights and Challenges
- **Task 1**: Choosing the right conditional and unconditional jumps was key to managing the program flow effectively.
- **Task 2**: Avoiding additional memory usage required careful handling of indexed operations.
- **Task 3**: Managing stack operations highlighted the importance of register preservation in modular programming.
- **Task 4**: Simulating hardware control required creative approaches to mimic sensor input and memory manipulation.
