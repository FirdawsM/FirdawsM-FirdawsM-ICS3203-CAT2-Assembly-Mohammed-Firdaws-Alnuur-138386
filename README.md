## Task 1: Control Flow and Conditional Logic
- **Purpose**:  
  This program prompts the user for a number and classifies it as either "POSITIVE", "NEGATIVE", or "ZERO" using conditional and unconditional jumps in assembly language.
- **Challenges**:  
  Ensuring the correct use of jump instructions (conditional and unconditional) to handle branching logic.

## Task 2: Array Manipulation with Looping and Reversal
- **Purpose**:  
  This program accepts an array of integers, reverses the array in place using loops, and outputs the reversed array.
- **Challenges**:  
  - Handling memory directly for array reversal without using extra storage.  
  - Managing loops and memory addressing, especially with 64-bit registers.

## Task 3: Modular Program with Subroutines for Factorial Calculation
- **Purpose**:  
  This program calculates the factorial of a number using a subroutine and the stack to preserve register values.
- **Challenges**:  
  - Correctly managing the stack to preserve values across subroutine calls.  
  - Handling larger numbers and ensuring proper storage and output of results.

## Task 4: Data Monitoring and Control Using Port-Based Simulation
- **Purpose**:  
  Simulates a control system that reads a sensor value and performs actions (e.g., turning on a motor or triggering an alarm) based on the sensor value.
- **Challenges**:  
  - Simulating control systems using assembly language.  
  - Managing memory or ports to simulate hardware control.  
  - WSL compatibility issues with ELF binaries, requiring an upgrade to WSL 2.

## Git Clone and Setup
To get started with this project, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FirdawsM/FirdawsM-FirdawsM-ICS3203-CAT2-Assembly-Mohammed-Firdaws-Alnuur-138386.git
cd FirdawsM-FirdawsM-ICS3203-CAT2-Assembly-Mohammed-Firdaws-Alnuur-138386
```
## Compilation and Execution
- **Prerequisites**: Install [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) or another assembler.
### Compiling and Running the Code

To compile and run the programs, follow these steps:

1. **Assemble the Code**:
```sh
  
   nasm -f elf64 -o taskX.o taskX.asm
   ```
```
   Replace taskX.asm with the appropriate file 
```
```
   for each task (task1.asm, task2.asm, task3.asm, task4.asm )
   ```

- **Link the Object File**:
```sh

ld -no-pie -o taskX taskX.o
```
-**Make the Binary Executable**:
```sh

chmod +x taskX
```

-**Run the Program**:
```sh 

./taskX
```


This will execute the program, and you can provide the necessary input as prompted by the program.
## Insights and Challenges
**Challenges Faced:**
- **Task 1**: 
Handling Memory in Assembly:

A key challenge across all tasks was dealing with memory directly in assembly, especially for tasks like reversing an array or handling large numbers (like calculating factorials). This required a deep understanding of memory addressing and register management.
Assembly Looping:

- **Task 2**: (array reversal) required using loops to manipulate the array in place. This posed challenges with managing the arrayâ€™s indices and ensuring correct pointer increments and decrements during the reversal process.

- **Task 3**: involved calculating the factorial using subroutines. Managing the stack correctly to preserve registers between function calls was crucial. Failure to manage this properly could lead to incorrect results or crashes.

- **Task 4:** 

- WSL Compatibility Issues:

WSL 1 does not support running ELF binaries natively, resulting in the "Exec format error" when trying to execute the binary. After upgrading to WSL 2, which fully supports ELF binaries, the issue was resolved. This was an important lesson about platform compatibility when working with low-level languages like assembly.

- Correctly Printing Output:

A recurring challenge was ensuring that the output was printed correctly, especially for sensor values and control statuses (e.g., motor or alarm states). The print_hex and print_newline functions had to be adjusted to ensure proper formatting and clarity in the output.
